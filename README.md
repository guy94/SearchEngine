# SearchEngine
Over a dataset of 10 milion tweets we built a search engine using NLP models. While building a parser, indexer, searcher and a ranker etc. as crucial components in a search engine, 
we experienced big scale programming for the first time. we had to deal with external-sorting, handle big ammounts of data and think outside the box for efficiency improvment
while attempting to achieve the best results for user queries.
